### [Live preview of the project here](https://ci-final-project.herokuapp.com/)

The goal of this project was to create a Fullstack Web Aplication using Django Framework.  
The ideea of Bug Issue Tracker has been choosen from the assessment brief.  
The purpose of the project is to allow users to submit their Bugs and Features requests.  
Bugs are free of charge and the solution for every bug will be posted public as a comment to that specific bug requested, but Features have a development cost of Â£10 and every developed Feature will be sent to the user by email when payment has beem received.
   
## UX  

#### User Stories   
 * As a user, I would like to be able to read Bugs and Features posts
 * As a user, I would like to be able to create an account and log in to the web site to:   
 	* submit a Bug or Feature fix request
 	* comment on a Bug or Feature post
 	* add items to cart 
 	* pay securely
 	* edit a Bug or Feature previously submited
 	* delete a Bug or Feature previously submited
 	* edit a comment previously submited
 	* delete a comment previously submited
 * As a user, I would like to be able to reset my password
 * As a user, I would like to see statistics so that I can have an ideea about how the site is doing  
 * As a user, I would like to be able to read Blog posts

## Technologies Used  

* **Sublime Text** - this IDE was used to write the project
* **HTML** 
* **CSS** - was used for styles, colors
* **JavaScript** - used for some elements on the front end of the project
* **jQuery** - used for some elements on the front end of the project

* **Python** - used as main language for server-side of the project
* **Django** - python framework used for server-side 
* **Stripe** - used to process payments 
* **Chart.js** - used for statistics
* **MySQL** - Postgres/Sqlite3 - used for relational databeses 
* **AWS S3 Bucket** - used to store static files 
* **Travis CI** - used for coutinuos testing  
* **Heroku** - used for deployement  


## Testing  

This project was tested across diifferent browsers and devices.  
The code has been checked with PEP8 checker and validator.w3.  
Most often the warnings came from **tab indentation** which is expected as the IDE was setted to use TAB for indentation and the HTML validator did not recognized Django tags.

##### Main Errors Encountered 
1. Token 
	* During integration of Stripe for payments the main error faced was token not being generated - solved by implementing version 3 of Stripe.   

2. Like button  
	* the like button created for `Bugs` can be clicked as many times as the user want, instead of just once. However, it has not been fixed yet due to time left to submit this project.  
	
3. Password reset  
	* when user requested a password reset an error showed up and fails to send the password reset email to the user - solved by changing the security settings on google account.  

4. Deployment  
	* the deployment failed on collecting the static files and worked only with `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`. I manage to overcome this by using `BOTO3` package.  
	
## Deployment 

For this project I used Sublime Text as text editor, git version control, GitHub to host the code versions and Heroku for deployment.

###### Deploying to Heroku  

* set all secret keys to environment variables to an env.py file and added to `.gitignore`  
* created `requirements.txt` file
* created `Procfile`
* created a Heroku app, linked it with the github repository and enabled automatic deployment   
* set up Postgres Hobby Dev database on heroku  
* I connected to Heroku from terminal using `heroku login` command  
* set up the environment variables on heroku using `heroku config:set <VAR_NAME>="<VAR_VALUE>"`  
* added Heroku url to allowed hosts  
* pushed code using `git push -u origin master`  
* after deploying run commands `heroku run python manage.py migrate` to create the database models and `heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin user  

###### Local Deployment  

To deploy this project locally: 

* Clone or Download the GitHub repository  
* Create a virtual environment and activate it    
* Install the packages from requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` command
* Set environment variables  
* Run migrations to create databese models using `python manage.py makemigrations` then `python manage.py migrate`
* Create a super user using `python manage.py createsuperuser` command
* Run the server with `python manage.py runserver` command
